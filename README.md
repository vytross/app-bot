# app-bot
ProtoTech's application Discord bot! While the webhook was made by @mattymatty97 and @polarbub (and is necessary to make this actually work), this part is mine. The webhook can be found at [REDACTED], or by just asking me or one of those two to provide it.

HOW TO USE:
- Initialize discord.js in whatever folder you choose
- Copy and paste over the index.js file and applications folder (the bot won't auto-create the folder and needs it to store files)
- Change the channel ID at line 37 to wherever your webhook is spitting out the data
- Set up a config.json file to have your personal bot's token (obviously not sharing that here)
- Run the thing and hope it works, if it doesn't I'm not helping you
